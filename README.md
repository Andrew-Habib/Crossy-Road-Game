"# Crossy-Road-Game" 

This program was made using Python and the tkinter module. It was a Grade 12 programming project that is a replica of the famous crossy road except in 2D.

The game is composed of a chicken that attempts to crossy busy roads while trying not to get run over. The game increases with difficulty every time the chicken gets to the end and there is a scoring system.
